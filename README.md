## Reflection

### Wins

- UI - quite proud of how it turned out. Simple and but not too minimalistic as to still maintain some character.
- Logic - this project was the most difficult compared to the previous one due to this sole reason. It took me 3 days and 2 extra branches to finally figure out -- and the end product could DEFINITELY be improved a lot more. But in the end, it's my biggest win (I felt so relieved when it finally clicked together).

### Hurdles

- Logic - whilst it was my biggest win it was also my biggest hurdle. I came into this project thinking I could code my way through it instantly without having to go to the planning board. In hindsight, after 3 days, and 2 separate branches (because I got so stressed I had to start clean twice), that was probably a bad decision.
- Lack of HTML/CSS skills - this isn't so much as a hurdle but I feel like some of the stuff I had in mind for the UI couldn't be done with my current knowledge of HTML/CSS. Like the little github picture on the footer: I wanted to add an animation whenever the mouse is hovered over it but as I tried doing it in my last project the flexbox caused the whole footer position to shift. I COULD spend more time researching it on my own, but I didn't want to spend too long on the project.

### Takeaway

- Pseudocodes are important, yo.
- Tackling small solvable problems first before going to big ones seem to be working quite well for me.
- Manage my time better -- I didn't set myself a dedicated time for the project which led to a lot of other things neglected. Though arguably, my time management skills are still somewhat trash anyway so this is a more general problem than the others.
